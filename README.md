# theater.io

Hello again!! Welcome to my prototype of a movie theater application.

---

Thank you for joining me in my coding journey!!

### Description

A web application for a movie theater where customers can reserve and pay for their tickets, discover new movies and find more information. `theater.io` was made with the t3 stack, clerk, stripe, supabase and mantineUI.

### Setup

1. Run `npm install` so every dependency in the package.json file installs correctly.
2. Create a .env file and pass the correct information for every key (use sample.env as an example).
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application on a local server.
